# Muon-detector-simulator

[This](muon_simulator.py) is a very simple muon detector simulator built to visualize in an intuitive way an experiment done in laboratory(*). (Requirements: pygame, numpy, time and standard libraries) 

[This](muons_analysis.py) is a quite simple algorithm that analize a video frame by frame, dividing it into a grid and searching for luminosity changes (the count of muons is not precise if the grid is not well aligned and needs to be improved). (Requirements: cv2, numpy, time and standard libraries) 

(*) These codes were originally developed for an experiment regarding a muon detector, built during an hackathon (https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/hackathon/home) by three physics students.
